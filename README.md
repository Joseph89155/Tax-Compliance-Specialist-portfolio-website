## 🎨 Design Philosophy

The website is modeled after a **Premium Business Card**. 
-   **The Palette**: Uses deep Navy Blue to signify stability and Gold to represent excellence and financial growth.
-   **Typography**: Combines high-contrast Serifs for headings to evoke authority and clean Sans-Serifs for body text to ensure readability.
-   **Space**: Utilizes generous padding and "dark mode" defaults to create a luxurious, focused user experience.
